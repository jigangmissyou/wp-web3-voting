## Description

This plugin is a simple yet functional **WordPress block widget** for voting, powered by a **Smart Contract** on the blockchain.

Designed for experimentation and fun, this project was created shortly after learning the fundamentals of blockchain development. The goal was to explore how decentralized technologies can be integrated with WordPress in a lightweight and user-friendly way.

With this block, you can easily embed blockchain-based voting functionality into your WordPress site â€” no complex setup required.
